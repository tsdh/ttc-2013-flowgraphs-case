* The 4 Flowgraph Tasks

  1. A *model-to-model transformation* from JaMoPP to a simple StructureGraph
  2. An *in-place transformation* synthesizing control flow edges
  3. An *in-place transformation* synthesizing data flow edges
  4. A *DSL development* task for *validation*

* Task 1

  - Model-to-model transformation
    + Transform JaMoPP to StructureGraph
  - Model-to-text transformation
    + Serialize JaMoPP statements back to text

** Task 1: Metamodels

  - Input metamodel (JaMoPP, complete abstract syntax of Java)
    - 237 classes,15 attributes, 105 references, 319 specializations
  - Output metamodel (StructureGraph)

** Task 1: Models

   - smallest input model: 53 objects, 67 references
   - largest input model: 48465 objects, 60367 references

** Task 1: Example

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Test1 {
        public static void testMethod(int a) {
                int i = a * 2;
                i = i + 19;
                while (i > a) {
                        if (a < 1) {
                                return;
                        } else if (a == 1) {
                                break;
                        }
                        i--;
                }
        }
}

* Task 2

  - In-place transformation
  - *Synthesize control flow edges* in the StructureGraphs according to the
    Java semantics
  - Not that easy in the presence of deeply nested /if/loops/ with /break/ and
    /continue/

** Task 2: Metamodel

** [[./sg.png]]

** [[./cfg.png]]

* Task 3

  - Model-to-model transformation
    + Extend task 1's transformation so that it creates /Var/ objects and sets
      /def/ and /use/ references
  - In-place transformation
    + *Synthesize data flow edges* in the model resulting from applying the
      extended task 1 transformation + the task 2 transformation

** Task 3: Metamodel

** [[./cfg-with-vars.png]]

** [[./dfg.png]]

* Task 4

  - Create a *simple DSL* that allows for
    + defining *specs of expected control and data flow links*
    + using a syntax usable by Java programmers not knowing about models
  - Provide a tool that takes such specs to *validate result model*
    + Enumerate missing control/data flow links
    + Enumerate false control/data flow links

** Task 4: Example DSL

#+BEGIN_SRC
cfNext: "testMethod()"   --> "int a = 1;"
cfNext: "int a = 1;"     --> "int b = 2;"
cfNext: "int b = 2;"     --> "int c = a + b;"
cfNext: "int c = a + b;" --> "a = c;"
cfNext: "a = c;"         --> "b = a;"
cfNext: "b = a;"         --> "c = a / b;"
cfNext: "c = a / b;"     --> "b = a - b;"
cfNext: "b = a - b;"     --> "return b * c;"
cfNext: "return b * c;"  --> "Exit"

dfNext: "int a = 1;"     --> "int c = a + b;"
dfNext: "int b = 2;"     --> "int c = a + b;"
dfNext: "int c = a + b;" --> "a = c;"
dfNext: "a = c;"         --> "b = a;"
dfNext: "a = c;"         --> "c = a / b;"
dfNext: "a = c;"         --> "b = a - b;"
dfNext: "b = a;"         --> "c = a / b;"
dfNext: "b = a;"         --> "b = a - b;"
dfNext: "c = a / b;"     --> "return b * c;"
dfNext: "b = a - b;"     --> "return b * c;"

* Evaluation Criteria

** Objective Criteria

   - The objectively measurable criteria have already been assessed in an open
     peer review
     - *Completeness*
     - *Correctness*
     - *Efficiency*

** Subjective Criteria

   - Have also been assessed in an open peer review, and now you can add your
     votes, too
   - *Overall score*
     + of the solution itself (i.e., its results)
     + of the solution presentation
   - *Perceived language quality*
     + how *useful* do you think it is?
     + how *easy to use* does it seem to be?
     + how *understandable & concise* do you think the solution is?
   - *Perceived tool quality* (Editor, IDE, Debugger, Visualization, etc.)
     + how *useful* do you think it is?
     + how *easy to use* does it seem to be?

* Awards

  1. The best overall solution
  2. The most efficient solution
  3. The most concise & understandable solution
  4. The best solution for
     - Task 1 and 3.1 (M2M)
